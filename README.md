# Public Code Repository

This repository contains:
- Python code in Jupyter Notebooks

There are four folders with code examples for:
- Audits: code that details descriptives from Auditor General data from Kenya for FY 15-16. 
- Legislation: code that classifies state legislation data from Crowdpac
- Markets: code that analyzes passenger/driver market data 
- Polarization: code that scrapes data from left/right newspaper websites (e.g. Breitbart, Huffington Post) and builds a classifier for how close input text is to left/right news during a given time period  

It also currently ignores .Rda, .xls, .xlsx, .csv, and .sav files.
