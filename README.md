# Public Code Repository

This repository contains:
- Python code in Jupyter Notebooks
- It also currently ignores .Rda, .xls, .xlsx, .csv, and .sav files.

There are four folders with code examples for:
- *Audits*
	- Code example that details descriptives from Auditor General data from Kenya for FY 15-16. 
- *Legislation*
	- Code example that classifies state legislation data from Crowdpac.
- *Markets*
	- Code example that analyzes passenger/driver market data for an anonymous company for a VC.
- *Polarization*
	- Code example that scrapes data from left/right newspaper websites (e.g. Breitbart, Huffington Post) and builds a classifier for how close input text is to left/right news during a given time period.
